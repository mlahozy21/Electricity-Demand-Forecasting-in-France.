# Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-in-France.
Two projects of forecasting electricity demand, one with statistical learning and the other with deep learning.
The first one (with statistical learning) has been made with Samuel Molano and Mohamed Amine Grini.
https://github.com/SamuelMolano/ModelisationPredictive for the code part.
The second one (with deep learning) has been entirely made by me.
